# Interruption Handling

Learn how to configure your AI assistant to handle interruptions naturally.

## Understanding Interruptions

### What are Interruptions?

Interruptions occur when:

- Caller speaks while assistant is talking
- Caller cuts off mid-sentence
- Urgent questions arise
- Clarification needed immediately

### Why They Matter

Good interruption handling creates:

- Natural conversation flow
- Better user experience
- Higher satisfaction
- More efficient calls

## Interruption Strategies

### Immediate Stop

Stop speaking when interrupted:

**Best for:**
- Important information gathering
- Emergency situations
- Frustrated callers
- Time-sensitive calls

**Configuration:**
```
Interruption mode: Immediate
Sensitivity: High
Resume behavior: Don't resume
```

### Finish Sentence

Complete current thought:

**Best for:**
- Critical information delivery
- Complex explanations
- Legal disclaimers
- Important instructions

**Configuration:**
```
Interruption mode: Finish sentence
Sensitivity: Medium
Resume behavior: Optional
```

### Continue Speaking

Ignore interruptions:

**Best for:**
- Pre-recorded messages
- Compliance statements
- Critical warnings
- Time-sensitive announcements

**Configuration:**
```
Interruption mode: Continue
Sensitivity: Low
Resume behavior: Always complete
```

## Configuration

### Sensitivity Levels

**High Sensitivity:**
- Detects soft interruptions
- Responds to hesitations
- Quick to yield
- Risk: False positives

**Medium Sensitivity (Recommended):**
- Balanced approach
- Natural conversation
- Reduces false triggers
- Most human-like

**Low Sensitivity:**
- Only clear interruptions
- Less responsive
- Fewer disruptions
- Risk: Seems robotic

### Response Patterns

How assistant responds:

**Acknowledge:**
```
Caller: "Wait, I have a question—"
Assistant: "Of course! What's your question?"
```

**Continue Context:**
```
Caller: "Hold on—"
Assistant: "Sure, what would you like to know about what I just mentioned?"
```

**Reset:**
```
Caller: "Actually, never mind that..."
Assistant: "No problem. What can I help you with instead?"
```

## Best Practices

### Natural Flow

Create natural dialogue:

- Allow interruptions for questions
- Acknowledge interruptions
- Don't repeat unnecessarily
- Move conversation forward

### Context Retention

Remember what was discussed:

```
Assistant: "As I was mentioning about our pricing..."
[Caller interrupts]
Caller: "What about support?"
Assistant: "Great question. Our support is included in all plans. Now, back to pricing—we offer three tiers..."
```

### Urgency Detection

Detect urgent interruptions:

```
Caller: "WAIT! That's wrong!"
Assistant: "I apologize. Let me correct that right away. What specifically needs to be fixed?"
```

## Advanced Features

### Emotion Detection

Respond based on tone:

**Frustrated:**
- Yield immediately
- Show empathy
- Offer solutions

**Confused:**
- Pause and clarify
- Ask if they understand
- Offer more detail

**Excited:**
- Match enthusiasm
- Move quickly
- Capitalize on momentum

### Dynamic Adjustment

Adapt during conversation:

- Multiple interruptions → Become more concise
- Patient listener → Provide more detail
- Quick speaker → Match their pace
