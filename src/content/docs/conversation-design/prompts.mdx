# Prompt Engineering

Master the art of writing prompts that create effective AI assistant conversations.

## What is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting instructions that guide your AI assistant's behavior, personality, and capabilities.

### Why It Matters

Good prompts lead to:

- **Natural conversations**: Human-like interactions
- **Consistent behavior**: Predictable responses
- **Goal achievement**: Better outcomes
- **Brand alignment**: On-brand personality

## Prompt Structure

### Essential Components

Every prompt should include:

1. **Role definition**: Who the assistant is
2. **Objectives**: What it should accomplish
3. **Personality**: How it should behave
4. **Constraints**: What to avoid
5. **Examples**: Sample interactions

### Basic Template

```
You are [ROLE] for [COMPANY].

Your primary objectives:
- [Objective 1]
- [Objective 2]
- [Objective 3]

Personality traits:
- [Trait 1]
- [Trait 2]

Never:
- [Constraint 1]
- [Constraint 2]

Example interaction:
Caller: [Question]
You: [Ideal response]
```

## Writing Effective Prompts

### Be Specific

❌ **Vague:**
```
Be helpful and answer questions.
```

✅ **Specific:**
```
You are a knowledgeable sales assistant. When asked about pricing, provide our standard rates and ask about their budget and needs to recommend the best plan.
```

### Define Personality

Create consistent character:

```
Communication style:
- Warm and friendly, but professional
- Patient with questions
- Enthusiastic about our product
- Empathetic to concerns
- Concise and clear
```

### Set Boundaries

Clearly define limits:

```
You cannot:
- Make refund decisions (transfer to billing)
- Provide medical advice
- Promise specific outcomes
- Discount below 10%
- Access account passwords
```

### Include Examples

Show desired behavior:

```
Example 1 - Price Question:
Caller: "How much does it cost?"
You: "Great question! Our plans start at $99/month for our Starter package, which includes [features]. Can you tell me a bit about your needs so I can recommend the best fit?"

Example 2 - Objection:
Caller: "That seems expensive."
You: "I understand budget is important. Many customers find the ROI worth it because [value]. What specific concerns do you have about the pricing?"
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Context Variables

Use dynamic information:

```
Greet the caller: "Hi {{first_name}}, thanks for your interest in {{product}}."

Reference history: "I see you attended our webinar on {{date}}. What questions did that bring up?"
```

### Conditional Logic

Handle different scenarios:

```
If caller is existing customer:
  - Thank them for their business
  - Ask about their experience
  - Offer upgrades or add-ons

If caller is new prospect:
  - Learn about their needs
  - Qualify budget and timeline
  - Schedule demo
```

### Tone Adaptation

Adjust based on context:

```
If caller is frustrated:
  - Use empathetic language
  - Acknowledge their concern
  - Focus on solutions
  - Offer escalation if needed

If caller is enthusiastic:
  - Match their energy
  - Move forward quickly
  - Capitalize on momentum
```

## Testing and Iteration

### Evaluation Criteria

Test prompts for:

- **Accuracy**: Correct information
- **Tone**: Appropriate personality
- **Efficiency**: Concise responses
- **Goal achievement**: Desired outcomes
- **Edge cases**: Unusual situations

### Iterative Improvement

1. Write initial prompt
2. Test with various scenarios
3. Identify issues
4. Refine prompt
5. Retest
6. Deploy
7. Monitor real performance
8. Continue optimizing
