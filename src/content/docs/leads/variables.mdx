# Lead Variables

Use lead data to personalize AI assistant conversations.

## What are Lead Variables?

Variables are placeholders that get replaced with actual lead data during calls.

### Benefits

- Personalized conversations
- Dynamic content
- Context-aware responses
- Better engagement

## Standard Variables

### Available Variables

Built-in variables:

- `{{first_name}}` - Lead's first name
- `{{last_name}}` - Lead's last name
- `{{full_name}}` - First and last name
- `{{email}}` - Email address
- `{{phone}}` - Phone number
- `{{company}}` - Company name

### Usage Example

```
Hi {{first_name}}, I'm calling from Spotzy.ai regarding your inquiry about {{product_interest}}.
```

Becomes:

```
Hi John, I'm calling from Spotzy.ai regarding your inquiry about Enterprise Solutions.
```

## Custom Variables

### Creating Custom Variables

Add custom fields:

1. Define custom lead fields
2. Use in assistant prompts
3. Access via `{{custom_field_name}}`

### Example Custom Variables

- `{{industry}}` - Lead's industry
- `{{budget}}` - Budget range
- `{{interest_level}}` - Interest rating
- `{{last_interaction}}` - Last contact date
- `{{source}}` - Lead source

## Advanced Usage

### Conditional Logic

Use variables in conditions:

```
{{#if industry == "healthcare"}}
I understand healthcare compliance is critical...
{{else}}
Let me tell you about our solution...
{{/if}}
```

### Fallback Values

Handle missing data:

```
Hi {{first_name | "there"}}, thanks for your interest!
```

If `first_name` is empty, uses "there" instead.

## Best Practices

### Personalization

Do:
- Use first names naturally
- Reference specific interests
- Mention company context

Don't:
- Overuse personalization
- Sound robotic
- Use sensitive data inappropriately

### Data Quality

Ensure quality:

- Validate data before import
- Clean formatting
- Handle missing values
- Test with sample data
