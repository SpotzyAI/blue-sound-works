# Voicemail Handling

Configure how your AI assistant handles voicemail when making outbound calls.

## Voicemail Detection

### How It Works

AI detects voicemail through:

- **Audio patterns**: Beep detection
- **Silence patterns**: Post-greeting pause
- **Duration**: Greeting length
- **Machine learning**: Pattern recognition

### Accuracy

Detection is approximately:

- **95%+ accurate**: Standard greetings
- **Lower accuracy**: Custom/unusual greetings
- **Configurable**: Adjust sensitivity

## Voicemail Options

### Leave Message

AI leaves a pre-configured message:

```
"Hi [Name], this is [Assistant] calling from [Company] regarding [Topic]. Please give us a call back at [Number]. Thanks!"
```

### Benefits
- Brand awareness
- Call-back opportunity
- Professional touch
- Information delivery

### Hang Up

Don't leave message:

- **Use when**: Message unnecessary
- **Saves**: Cost and time
- **Strategy**: Try again later
- **Retry**: Schedule follow-up attempt

## Message Configuration

### Creating Voicemail Scripts

Best practices:

- **Keep it short**: 20-30 seconds max
- **Clear purpose**: Why you're calling
- **Callback number**: Easy to remember
- **Friendly tone**: Warm and professional

### Example Scripts

**Appointment Reminder:**
```
"Hi [Name], this is a friendly reminder about your appointment with [Provider] on [Date] at [Time]. If you need to reschedule, please call [Number]. See you then!"
```

**Lead Follow-up:**
```
"Hi [Name], I'm following up on your interest in [Product]. I'd love to answer any questions. You can reach me at [Number]. Looking forward to speaking with you!"
```

**Survey Request:**
```
"Hi [Name], we'd appreciate your feedback about your recent experience with [Company]. Please call [Number] to share your thoughts. It'll only take 2 minutes. Thank you!"
```

## Advanced Settings

### Voicemail Detection Sensitivity

Adjust detection:

- **High sensitivity**: Detect more, risk false positives
- **Medium**: Balanced (recommended)
- **Low sensitivity**: Conservative, may miss some

### Custom Beep Detection

Configure beep waiting:

- **Wait time**: Seconds to wait for beep
- **Timeout**: Maximum wait duration
- **Start time**: When to start message
- **Silence threshold**: Define silence

## Strategy

### When to Leave Messages

Leave messages when:

- First attempt to contact
- Important information
- Appointment reminders
- Time-sensitive offers
- Follow-up requested

### When to Hang Up

Skip messages when:

- Multiple attempts already
- Low-priority outreach
- Testing campaigns
- High-volume calling
- Cost optimization focus

## Retry Logic

### After Voicemail

Configure retry behavior:

- **Wait time**: Hours/days before retry
- **Max attempts**: Total retry limit
- **Time of day**: Better times to reach
- **Method**: Try different channel (SMS, email)
