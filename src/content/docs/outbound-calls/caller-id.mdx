# Caller ID Configuration

Configure what phone number appears when your AI assistant makes outbound calls.

## Why Caller ID Matters

### Answer Rates

Local caller ID improves answer rates:

- **Local numbers**: Up to 4x better answer rate
- **Toll-free**: Professional but lower answer rate
- **Unknown**: Often ignored
- **Blocked**: Rarely answered

### Brand Recognition

Consistent caller ID builds:

- Trust and recognition
- Brand awareness
- Professional image
- Call-back option

## Caller ID Options

### Use Your Numbers

Display numbers you own:

- **Primary**: Main business line
- **Local**: Match recipient area code
- **Toll-free**: Brand number
- **Department**: Specific line

### Number Pools

Rotate through multiple numbers:

- **Local presence**: Match each area code
- **Carrier compliance**: Avoid spam flags
- **Volume distribution**: Prevent blocking
- **Fallback options**: Redundancy

## Configuration

### Setting Default Caller ID

1. Go to Campaigns or Assistant settings
2. Select "Caller ID"
3. Choose from your numbers
4. Set as default
5. Save changes

### Dynamic Caller ID

Match recipient location:

```
If recipient area code = 212 (NYC)
Use caller ID with 212 area code

If recipient area code = 415 (SF)
Use caller ID with 415 area code
```

## Compliance

### STIR/SHAKEN

Caller ID authentication:

- **Verified**: Green checkmark
- **Unverified**: No indicator
- **Spoofed**: Red warning

### Registration

Register your numbers:

- **Carrier registration**: Verify legitimacy
- **Brand registration**: Company info
- **Campaign registration**: Use case description

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- Vary caller IDs
- Improve answer rates

**Caller ID not displaying:**
- Verify number ownership
- Check carrier settings
- Confirm CNAM registration
