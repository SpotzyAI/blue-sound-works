# How it Works

Spotzy.ai combines multiple AI technologies to create natural phone conversations.

## Platform Architecture

1. **Speech Recognition**: Converts spoken words to text
2. **Natural Language Processing**: Understands intent and context
3. **AI Response Generation**: Creates appropriate responses
4. **Text-to-Speech**: Converts responses back to natural speech
5. **Call Management**: Handles routing and recording

## Workflow

```
Incoming Call → Speech Recognition → AI Processing → Response Generation → Voice Synthesis → Outbound Audio
```
