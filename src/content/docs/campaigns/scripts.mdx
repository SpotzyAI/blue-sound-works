# Campaign Scripts

Learn how to write compelling scripts that drive campaign success.

## Script Structure

### Opening

First 3-5 seconds are critical:

```
Hi [First Name], this is [Assistant Name] calling from [Company].
I'm reaching out because [brief reason].
Do you have a moment to chat?
```

### Value Proposition

Quickly communicate value:

- What problem you solve
- How you can help
- Why they should listen

### Engagement Questions

Ask open-ended questions:

- Understand their needs
- Qualify interest level
- Build rapport
- Gather information

### Call to Action

Clear next steps:

- Schedule a meeting
- Send information
- Transfer to sales
- Book a demo

## Writing Tips

### Keep It Natural

Write how people speak:

- Use contractions
- Short sentences
- Simple language
- Conversational tone

### Personalization

Use dynamic variables:

- `[First Name]`
- `[Company]`
- `[Industry]`
- `[Custom Field]`

### Handle Objections

Prepare responses for common objections:

- "I'm busy" → Offer to call back at better time
- "Not interested" → Brief value prop, respect decision
- "Send information" → Collect email, set expectations

## Example Scripts

### Lead Qualification

```
Hi [First Name], this is Sarah from Spotzy.ai.

I'm calling to learn more about how you're currently handling customer calls at [Company]. Many companies in the [Industry] sector are struggling with missed calls and long wait times.

We've helped similar companies increase their answer rate by 90% with AI phone assistants. 

Would you be open to a brief 10-minute conversation about your current call handling process?
```

### Appointment Reminder

```
Hi [First Name], this is a friendly reminder about your upcoming appointment with [Provider] on [Date] at [Time].

If you need to reschedule or have any questions, just let me know and I can help with that.

Otherwise, we look forward to seeing you on [Date]. Have a great day!
