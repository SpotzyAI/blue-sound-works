# Call Routing

Set up sophisticated call routing rules to direct incoming calls appropriately.

## Routing Strategies

Route calls directly to specific assistants:

- **One-to-one**: Each number to one assistant
- **Simple**: Easy to configure
- **Fast**: No decision logic needed

### IVR Routing

Interactive Voice Response menus:

```
"Press 1 for Sales"
"Press 2 for Support"
"Press 3 for Billing"
```

### Time-Based Routing

Route based on time:

- **Business hours**: AI assistant
- **After hours**: Different assistant or voicemail
- **Weekends**: Special handling
- **Holidays**: Holiday message

### Skills-Based Routing

Route based on caller needs:

- **Language**: Match caller language
